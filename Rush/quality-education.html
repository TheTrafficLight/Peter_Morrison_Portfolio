    <h1>Quality Education</h1>

    <div class="middleColumn">
        <p>In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 goals as a part of their sustainable development agenda.  One of such goals is “Quality Education” The UN gives a definition for this goal on their website:</p>
    </div>

    <p class="quote">Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all</p>

    <div class="middleColumn">
        <p>
            However, the current systems of education adopted by most countries don’t achieve this. These systems fail to provide equitable quality education. The standard of education is currently not good enough.
            This is something that I am passionate about. I have had poor experiences with education myself and have often become frustrated with the current quality of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            I consider myself to be a fast learner but have found that the education system was unable to extend me in the areas that I needed extension. A great example of this was my music lessons when I began high school.
            I had already learnt a lot about music before this class, but because the education system needed to allow for students with no experience, I was stuck learning topics I had covered years ago.
            This was a horrible experience as I had to endure hours of this lesson a week doing nothing. This shows one of the education system’s many flaws; students are unable to learn at their own pace.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Not everyone can be expected to learn at the same speed. Some people are better at learning and some people are worse. However, the current education systems are designed to require students to learn at the same speed for ease of teaching.
            This fails the UN’s requirements of education being equitable as it treats every student the same regardless of their individual needs.
        </p>
        <p>A potential solution for this is to stop separating students by year and instead separate them by ability. After you finish high school, you will always be working with people of different ages as it is a better system.
            People who are more skilled get the better jobs, not just people who are older. While skill may come from age, it can also come from other places and schools should embrace this.
            My experiences at 42 Adelaide are a great example of how someone who is younger can be learning just as well as someone two years older.

        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the curriculum is designed to be almost the same for everyone, regardless of what they want to do when they get older. During high school, everyone is required to take the same subjects, meaning that a lot of the content they learn will never be used again.
            Have you ever heard someone say that 90% of what you learn in school is useless? That’s because it is, but this shouldn't be the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lots of the classwork is learning for the sake of learning and won’t be useful later in life. By giving students more choices about what they want to study early, it could make students enjoy school a lot more.
            Many students hate the work they do at school, but often that is just because they aren’t passionate about what they are doing. There’s no point in trying to teach someone how to do something they hate doing if they will never need to do it again.
            Because almost all education teaches the same topics because they follow a curriculum, it’s not inclusive as not all students will thrive this way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, the coursework is very close-ended and doesn’t allow for much creativity. This prevents students for exploring topics themselves and discourages learning in their own time. It also makes doing the work a lot more boring, a major point of dislike from students.
            When students are allowed to be creative, it allows for passion and a higher level of engagement, providing a higher quality of education. Of the many assignments I have had, few have allowed for creativity, but the ones that have received a higher level of effort.
            If all assignments were like this, students could work at their best, improving the quality of education.
        </p>
        <p>
            These examples show how the education system and curriculum are flawed. Many people still struggle greatly with education and suffer later in life because of this, but that shouldn’t be the case.
            The UN created this goal as having a quality education that accommodates all students of all types is vital to improve the world. If everyone is learning to the bets of their abilities while they are young, the future will hold many great advancements for humankind.
